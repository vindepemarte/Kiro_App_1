- **Implemented performance monitoring utilities** with timing and memory tracking
- **Added optimized real-time listeners** with batching and change detection
- **Updated hooks** (`hooks/use-team-realtime.ts`) to use optimized listeners with caching

**Key Improvements:**
- Batched updates with configurable delays (100-150ms) to reduce re-renders
- Change detection to prevent unnecessary callbacks
- Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup
- Performance monitoring and statistics collection

### ✅ 2. Optimize Database Queries
- **Created database optimization service** (`lib/database-optimization.ts`)
- **Implemented intelligent query caching** with LRU eviction and TTL
- **Added optimized query methods** for meetings, teams, and notifications
- **Implemented batch operations** for better performance

**Key Optimizations:**
- LRU cache with configurable TTL (2-15 minutes based on data type)
- Query result caching with intelligent invalidation
- Optimized Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Batch processing for concurrent operations

### ✅ 3. Implement Data Caching
- **Created comprehensive data caching service** (`lib/data-cache-service.ts`)
- **Implemented multi-level caching** for different data types
- **Added cache warming and invalidation strategies**
- **Integrated performance monitoring and health checks**

**Cache Features:**
- Individual data caches (meetings, teams, users, notifications)
- Query result caches with automatic invalidation
- LRU eviction with configurable size limits
- Cache health monitoring with recommendations
- Approximate memory usage tracking

## Implementation Details

### Database Optimization Features
```typescript
// Optimized queries with caching
const meetings = await databaseOptimizer.getOptimizedUserMeetings(userId, {
  limit: 20,
  useCache: true,
  orderBy: 'createdAt',
  orderDirection: 'desc'
});

// Optimized real-time listeners with batching
const unsubscribe = databaseOptimizer.subscribeToOptimizedUserMeetings(
  userId,
  (meetings) => setMeetings(meetings),
  { batchDelay: 100, limit: 50 }
);
```

### Caching Service Features
```typescript
// Multi-level caching with automatic invalidation
dataCacheService.setMeeting(meetingId, meeting);
dataCacheService.setUserMeetings(userId, meetings);

// Cache health monitoring
const health = dataCacheService.getCacheHealth();
// Returns: hitRate, lowPerformingCaches, recommendations
```

### Real-time Optimization Features
```typescript
// Optimized hooks with caching
const { team, loading, error } = useTeamRealtime(teamId);
// Uses cached data first, then subscribes to real-time updates

// Batched updates to prevent excessive re-renders
const { teams } = useUserTeamsRealtime(userId);
// Batches team updates with 150ms delay
```
