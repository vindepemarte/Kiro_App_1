# Notification and Task Display Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MeetingAI system has critical issues with the notification system and task display functionality. Users cannot see notifications, task assignments fail to send notifications, and the tasks page doesn't show assigned tasks. These are core features that must work for the application to be functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Notification Service Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive and view notifications for team invitations, task assignments, and meeting updates, so that I stay informed about important activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notification service is called THEN getUserNotifications SHALL be available and functional
2. WHEN a task is assigned THEN sendTaskAssignmentNotification SHALL be available and send notifications
3. WHEN notifications are loaded THEN they SHALL display in the notification center without errors
4. WHEN notification counts are requested THEN the unread count SHALL be accurate and update in real-time
5. WHEN users interact with notifications THEN all notification actions SHALL work without undefined method errors

### Requirement 2: Fix Task Assignment Notifications

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive notifications when tasks are assigned to me, so that I know what work needs to be done.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is assigned to a user THEN a notification SHALL be created and sent to the assignee
2. WHEN task assignment notifications are sent THEN they SHALL appear in the user's notification center
3. WHEN task assignments fail THEN the system SHALL log the error but still complete the assignment
4. WHEN multiple tasks are assigned THEN each SHALL generate its own notification
5. WHEN task assignments are made in team meetings THEN all team members SHALL be notified appropriately

### Requirement 3: Fix Task Display on Tasks Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all tasks assigned to me on the tasks page, so that I can manage my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the tasks page THEN I SHALL see all tasks assigned to me from all meetings
2. WHEN I am assigned a task in a team meeting THEN it SHALL appear on my tasks page
3. WHEN team members are assigned tasks THEN they SHALL see those tasks on their tasks page
4. WHEN tasks are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in real-time on the tasks page
5. WHEN I filter or sort tasks THEN the functionality SHALL work correctly with all my assigned tasks

### Requirement 4: Fix Database Service Method Exports

**User Story:** As a system, I want all database service methods to be properly exported and accessible, so that other services can use them without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services import database methods THEN there SHALL be no duplicate exports causing conflicts
2. WHEN notification methods are called THEN they SHALL be properly bound to the database service instance
3. WHEN task-related methods are called THEN they SHALL be available and functional
4. WHEN the application starts THEN all service integrations SHALL work without undefined method errors

### Requirement 5: Fix Real-time Notification Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time notification updates, so that I see new notifications immediately without refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new notifications are created THEN they SHALL appear in real-time in the notification center
2. WHEN notification status changes THEN the updates SHALL be reflected immediately
3. WHEN the notification count changes THEN the badge SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN users are offline THEN notifications SHALL sync when they come back online
5. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN notifications SHALL sync across all tabs

### Requirement 6: Fix Task Service Integration

**User Story:** As a system, I want the task service to properly integrate with the database and notification services, so that task management works end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are retrieved THEN the task service SHALL return all user-assigned tasks from all sources
2. WHEN task status is updated THEN the changes SHALL be persisted and reflected in real-time
3. WHEN tasks are assigned THEN the task service SHALL coordinate with the notification service
4. WHEN team tasks are managed THEN the task service SHALL handle team context properly
5. WHEN task subscriptions are created THEN they SHALL provide real-time updates to the UI

## Success Criteria

- Notification center loads and displays notifications without errors
- Task assignment notifications are sent and received successfully
- Tasks page shows all assigned tasks for users
- Real-time updates work for both notifications and tasks
- No undefined method errors in the console
- All service integrations work seamlessly

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- Must not break existing working features
- Must handle edge cases gracefully
- Must provide clear error messages to users
- Must work with current authentication and team systems
