# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix the PostgreSQL adapter integration in a Next.js application. Currently, the build process fails because the PostgreSQL adapter is being imported in client-side code, causing webpack to try to resolve Node.js built-in modules like `fs`, `dns`, `net`, and `tls` which aren't available in the browser environment. We need to implement a solution that properly separates server-side and client-side code to ensure the application builds and runs correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the PostgreSQL adapter only runs on the server-side, so that the application can build and deploy successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the PostgreSQL adapter should only be imported and used in server-side code
2. WHEN the application is running in a browser environment THEN no Node.js-specific modules should be imported
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it should build without errors related to Node.js built-in modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing database functionality, so that the application continues to work as expected after the fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application uses the database service THEN it should correctly determine whether to use Firebase or PostgreSQL based on configuration
2. WHEN the application runs on the server THEN PostgreSQL connections should work properly
3. WHEN the application runs in the browser THEN it should gracefully handle the absence of PostgreSQL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean separation between client-side and server-side code, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows Next.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is executed in the browser THEN it should not attempt to import or use server-only modules
2. WHEN code is executed on the server THEN it should have access to all required Node.js modules
3. WHEN the application is modified in the future THEN the separation between client and server code should be clear and maintainable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper webpack configuration for the Next.js application, so that it correctly handles Node.js built-in modules during the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webpack builds the application THEN it should properly handle or exclude Node.js built-in modules
2. WHEN the application is built THEN there should be no webpack errors related to missing modules
3. IF Node.js modules are required in client-side code THEN webpack should be configured to provide appropriate fallbacks or empty implementations
