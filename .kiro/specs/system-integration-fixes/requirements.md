# System Integration Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MeetingAI system has multiple critical integration issues that are preventing core functionality from working properly. These issues span across meeting uploads, team invitations, user profiles, notifications, and UI components. This spec addresses all identified problems systematically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Meeting Upload System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload meeting transcripts successfully without database errors, so that I can process and analyze my meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a meeting transcript THEN the system SHALL save the meeting without "undefined teamId" errors
2. WHEN saving a meeting with no team assignment THEN the system SHALL handle null/undefined teamId values properly
3. WHEN a meeting is assigned to a team THEN the teamId SHALL be properly validated and stored
4. WHEN meeting data is processed THEN all required fields SHALL have valid values before database insertion

### Requirement 2: Fix User Profile Creation and Search

**User Story:** As a team admin, I want to search for and invite existing users to my team, so that I can build collaborative teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in for the first time THEN their profile SHALL be automatically created in userProfiles collection
2. WHEN searching for users by email THEN the system SHALL find users who have signed in at least once
3. WHEN a user creates a team THEN their profile SHALL be accessible for team member searches
4. WHEN inviting users THEN only users with existing profiles SHALL be invitable
5. WHEN a user accepts an invitation THEN they SHALL appear in the team member list immediately

### Requirement 3: Fix Team Invitation Workflow

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive, accept, and see the results of team invitations properly, so that I can participate in team collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is invited to a team THEN the notification SHALL be created with their real user ID (not temporary)
2. WHEN a user accepts a team invitation THEN they SHALL immediately appear as an active team member
3. WHEN a user accepts an invitation THEN they SHALL see the team in their teams list
4. WHEN team membership changes THEN all real-time listeners SHALL update immediately
5. WHEN a user is part of a team THEN they SHALL see team meetings in their dashboard

### Requirement 4: Fix Team Meetings Integration

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see meetings assigned to my teams in my dashboard, so that I can stay updated on team activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meeting is assigned to a team THEN all team members SHALL see it in their team meetings section
2. WHEN team meeting notifications are sent THEN they SHALL appear for all active team members
3. WHEN a user joins a team THEN they SHALL immediately see existing team meetings
4. WHEN team meetings are updated THEN notifications SHALL be sent to all team members

### Requirement 5: Fix UI Component Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate the application without encountering UI errors, so that I can use all features smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing team reports THEN Select components SHALL have valid non-empty values
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN no React component errors SHALL occur
3. WHEN team data loads THEN all UI components SHALL handle empty/null values gracefully
4. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN UI components SHALL update without errors

### Requirement 6: Fix Database Field Validation

**User Story:** As a system, I want to ensure all database operations use valid data, so that no "undefined" or invalid values are stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving any document THEN all fields SHALL have valid values (not undefined/null where required)
2. WHEN teamId is optional THEN it SHALL be omitted from the document rather than set to undefined
3. WHEN processing meeting data THEN all metadata fields SHALL have default values if not provided
4. WHEN creating notifications THEN all required fields SHALL be validated before saving

### Requirement 7: Fix Real-time Listeners and Permissions

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates to work without permission errors, so that I see live changes in teams and meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscribing to team updates THEN Firestore permissions SHALL allow the operation
2. WHEN team membership changes THEN real-time listeners SHALL receive updates immediately
3. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with user-friendly messages
4. WHEN users are offline THEN the system SHALL handle connection issues without breaking

### Requirement 8: Fix User Search and Profile Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user profiles to be created consistently and searchable, so that team invitations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in THEN their profile SHALL be created in both users and userProfiles collections
2. WHEN searching for users THEN the search SHALL work across all user collections consistently
3. WHEN user data is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL reconcile and fix the data automatically
4. WHEN profiles are missing THEN the system SHALL recreate them from authentication data

## Success Criteria

- All meeting uploads work without database errors
- Team invitations work end-to-end with real user IDs
- User search finds all registered users
- Team members see each other and team meetings
- No UI component errors in any page
- Real-time updates work without permission errors
- All database operations use valid, non-undefined values

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- Must not break existing working features
- Must handle edge cases gracefully
- Must provide clear error messages to users
- Must work with current Firestore security rules
