# Comprehensive System Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MeetingAI system requires comprehensive integration fixes to ensure all components work seamlessly together. This includes fixing task assignment and display, ensuring consistent navigation across devices, implementing real-time data synchronization, and optimizing the mobile experience. The system must function as a cohesive web application where meetings are analyzed, tasks are assigned to team members, notifications work properly, and all data is displayed in real-time.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user visits the tasks page THEN they SHALL see all tasks assigned to them from all meetings (personal and team)
3. WHEN a task is assigned to a user THEN they SHALL receive a notification about the assignment
4. WHEN a task status is updated THEN the change SHALL be reflected in real-time across all relevant views
5. WHEN a team admin assigns a task to a team member THEN the assignment SHALL be saved and visible immediately

### Requirement 2: Implement Consistent Navigation System

4. WHEN team membership changes THEN all affected users SHALL see the updates immediately
5. WHEN meeting data is updated THEN all relevant views SHALL reflect the changes immediately

### Requirement 4: Fix Database Task Storage and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a system, I want to properly store and retrieve task assignments, so that users can see their assigned tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meeting contains action items THEN each action item SHALL be stored with proper assignee information
2. WHEN querying user tasks THEN the system SHALL retrieve tasks from all meetings where the user is assigned
3. WHEN a task is created THEN it SHALL include meeting context, team context, and assignment details
4. WHEN tasks are displayed THEN they SHALL show meeting title, team name, due date, priority, and status
5. WHEN task data is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide data migration and cleanup utilities

### Requirement 5: Optimize Mobile User Experience
