# Team Invitation and Date Handling Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Team Management Date Error
**Problem**: `selectedTeam.createdAt.toLocaleDateString is not a function`
**Cause**: Date fields from PostgreSQL API were coming as strings, not Date objects
**Fix**: Updated `components/team-management.tsx` to convert string dates to Date objects before calling `toLocaleDateString()`

### 2. Notification Center Date Error  
**Problem**: `date.getTime is not a function` in NotificationCenter
**Cause**: Notification dates were strings instead of Date objects
**Fix**: 
- Updated `formatNotificationTime` function to handle both string and Date inputs
- Added proper date validation and error handling
- Updated `getUserNotifications` in client database adapter to convert date strings to Date objects

### 3. Meeting Save Failure
**Problem**: "Team-aware processing failed: Failed to save meeting"
**Cause**: PostgreSQL adapter was expecting fields that don't exist on `ProcessedMeeting` type
**Fix**: Updated PostgreSQL adapter's `saveMeeting` method to:
- Use correct field mapping from `ProcessedMeeting` structure
- Extract title from metadata filename
- Use `rawTranscript` for both transcript fields
- Handle missing fields gracefully

### 4. Team Member Date Handling
**Problem**: Potential date issues with team member data
**Fix**: Updated `getTeamMembers` in client database adapter to convert `joinedAt` strings to Date objects

## Files Modified

1. `components/notification-center.tsx` - Fixed date handling in formatNotificationTime
2. `components/team-management.tsx` - Fixed selectedTeam.createdAt date conversion
3. `lib/postgres-adapter.ts` - Fixed saveMeeting method to handle ProcessedMeeting structure
4. `lib/team-aware-processor.ts` - Added better error handling for meeting save failures
5. `lib/client-database-adapter.ts` - Fixed date conversion for notifications and team members

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test team creation and invitation flow
2. Test meeting upload with team assignment
3. Test notification display and formatting
4. Verify all date fields display correctly across the application

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was inconsistent date handling between the PostgreSQL backend and the React frontend. The PostgreSQL adapter was returning dates as ISO strings, but the frontend components expected Date objects. The client database adapter needed to consistently convert all date strings to Date objects to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase.
