**Problem**: Tasks page was empty even after task assignment
**Solution**:
- Fixed task service integration with proper real-time subscriptions

- Added proper team and user task filtering

## Files Modified

1. **lib/notification-service.ts** - Added missing notification methods
2. **lib/notification-service-simple.ts** - Created simple notification wrapper
3. **lib/database.ts** - Fixed notification imports and task assignment

## How to Test

### Test 1: Upload Team Meeting
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Select a team from "Process meeting for:" dropdown
3. Upload a meeting transcript
4. Should see success message without console errors

### Test 2: Assign Tasks
1. After uploading a team meeting, go to the meeting report
2. Try assigning tasks to team members
3. Should see "Task assigned successfully" message
4. Check console - should see notification logs instead of errors

### Test 3: View Tasks
1. Go to Tasks page
2. Should see assigned tasks from team meetings
3. Can filter by team and update task status

## Console Output Expected

Instead of errors, you should now see helpful logs like:
```
âœ… Meeting assignment notification: "Weekly Standup" assigned to team "Development Team"
âœ… Task assignment notification: "Update documentation" assigned to John Smith
âœ… Meeting update notification: Weekly Standup updated (summary)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test the workflow**:
   - Create/join a team
   - Upload a meeting for that team
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Check tasks page for assigned tasks
3. **Monitor console**: Should see notification logs instead of errors

## Future Enhancements

The current fix provides a working foundation. Future improvements could include:
- Real email notifications
- Push notifications
- Advanced task assignment algorithms
- Better error recovery
- Performance optimizations

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Clear browser cache** and restart dev server
2. **Check Firebase quota** in Firebase Console
3. **Verify team membership** - user must be active team member
4. **Check console logs** for specific error details

The app should now work smoothly for team collaboration and task assignment! ðŸŽ‰
